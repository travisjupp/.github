about: Add or update automated tests to verify specific logic flows.
title: 'test: '
labels: test

## Goal
[What specific logic flow are we verifying? e.g., "Verify LoadItem form factory correctly syncs state on input blur"]

## Proposed Changes
- [ ] [Setup Task: e.g., "Create LoadItem.integration.test.tsx using custom render"]
- [ ] [Mocking Task: e.g., "Mock the discovery and material hooks with initial state"]
- [ ] [Interaction Task: e.g., "Simulate user input and blur event on Discovery Term field"]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [Verification: e.g., "Terminal logger.ts output shows the correct DTO after blur"]
- [ ] [Stability: e.g., "Test passes consistently without native module crashes"]
- [ ] Logic flow verified via terminal logging or debugger
- [ ] Automated tests pass (`npm test`)
