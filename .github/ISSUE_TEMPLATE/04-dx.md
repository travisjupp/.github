### Improvement Goal
<How will this make development easier/faster? e.g., "Automate provider injection to reduce test boilerplate">

### Proposed Tasks
- [ ] <Infrastructure Task: e.g., "Add 'Wall of Providers' wrapper to test-utils.tsx">
- [ ] <Mocking Task: e.g., "Implement global mock for react-native-keyboard-controller">
- [ ] <Documentation Task: e.g., "Add usage examples for the new custom render to the README">

### Expected Result
<What is the specific 'quality of life' improvement? e.g., "New tests require 50% less setup code and no longer crash on native dependencies">

### Verification
- [ ] <Usage Check: e.g., "Successfully render a component using the new custom render utility">
- [ ] Build/Bundler successfully executes (no errors)
- [ ] Automated tests pass (`npm test`)
